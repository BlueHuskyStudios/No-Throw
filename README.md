No Throw
========

A library of common functions that _never_ throw exceptions, no matter what you put in! Though, it might give you output you didn't expect. Remember to [read the docs][1]!

Why?
----
This was created after our [research on the preference of bugs versus crashes](https://research.bhstudios.org/Surveys/Software/Problematics/) revealed that strange output is preferable to crashes.

Docs
----
Documentation can be found on [the No Throw github.io site][1].
