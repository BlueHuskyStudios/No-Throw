<a id="why" class="anchor" href="#why" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why?</h1>

<p>No Throw was started because we realized that most crashes were caused by the programmer being slightly off, in input or timing or other such simple things, but if the app had spat out garbage instead of crashing, the end result might be some ugly text or poorly-positioned UI. This library favors strange (but well-documented) behavior for strange input over crashing.</p>

<p>This is nothing new; Objective-C won't crash if you try to call a method on <code>nil</code>, and webpages won't crash if you use an invalid element. We just try to apply this to a wider slate.</p>
