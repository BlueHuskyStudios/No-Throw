  "name": "No Throw",
  "tagline": "For when you don't want your app to crash.",
  "body": "# Why?\r\nNo Throw was started because we realized that most crashes were caused by the programmer being slightly off, in input or timing or other such simple things, but if the app had spat out garbage instead of crashing, the end result might be some ugly text or poorly-positioned UI. This library favors strange (but well-documented) behavior for strange input over crashing.\r\n\r\nThis is nothing new; Objective-C won't crash if you try to call a method on `nil`, and webpages won't crash if you use an invalid element. We just try to apply this to a wider slate.\r\n\r\n# Documentation\r\nTo make sure you know what's going to happen, be sure to read the documentation, provided both in source code and as rich docs below:\r\n\r\n- [For the Java version](/library/java/docs)",
