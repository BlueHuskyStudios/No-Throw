     *                     index). If this is positive and larger than the length of {@code fullSequence}, it is
     *                     clamped to {@code length - 1}. If it is negative and larger than the negated length, it is
     *                     clamped to {@code 0}.
     * @param maxLength    The maximum length of the resulting character sequence. If this is {@code 0}, all logic in
     *                     this method is skipped, and the empty string is returned. If it is negative, {@code anchor}
     *                     is treated as an end. If it is positive and would overflow the string's length, all
     *                     characters after {@code anchor}, inclusive, are returned. If it is negative and would
     *                     overflow, all characters before {@code anchor}, inclusive, are returned.
     * @return The subsequence of the given full sequence, as defined by the given anchor and maximum length.
